- kaba-server (p2p/sync/websockets/policy/peer-seed) [coming soon](https://github.com/kaba-labs)
- kaba-cli (headless-console) [coming soon](https://github.com/kaba-labs)

### When & Code Audits

- kaba (in progress)
- kaba-server (in progress)
- kaba-cli (TBD)

### Documentation / Kaba HDK (hack-it development kit)

- In progress
- Past Manifest v3 to Real applications (native gpu/io) and edge compute (wasm)
- Kaba SDK or build your own.
  * window.kaba & window.security
  * Everything should be changeable.
  * Language shouldn't matter.
  * APIs are useful but everything should be possible.

### OS Support
* kaba
  - [x] Linux (Kaba Labs highly recommends using an operating system that can be verified for scientific use - important for both legal and/or industry applications. We also recommend only useing open hardware that has open and verifiable firmware)
  - [x] Apple (not recommended - undecidable. Kaba Labs will not offer support for Apple systems)
  - [x] Window (not recommended - undecidable. Kaba Labs will not offer support for Microsoft systems)
  - [x] Android  (Closed hardware is a risk but we will try.)
  - [] IOS (not recommended - undecidable. Kaba Labs will not offer support for Apple systems)

# TuringPi & Kaba Enclave (kaba-server/k3s)

Kaba Enclave is a turnkey stack configuration for a Kaba cluster and seed/peer server.

### What is it?

- [turingpi](https://turingpi.com/) + [kaba](https://kaba.ai)  = üíù
- Webasm, Redundancy, Networking, Storage, ML
- Meshtastic/LoRa routing to endpoints
- 3G/4G,WWAN LTE,GPS routing to endpoints
- Network Router / Network Security / RF Security
- docs & how-tos [coming soon](https://github.com/kaba-labs)
- build guide or kaba.ai pre-builds.
  
### Sync Is The New Cloud

- p2p/direct to endpoint by default
- .kaba routing - internal TLD
- mesh networks and compute on demand from linux computers
 ### Drop In Sensors to Matter and Zigbee

 - TBD
